# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Initial setup
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- All API routes are in `src/app/api/` with REST conventions
- Use shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui/`
- Use `@/` alias for src imports
- Components: Functional components with React hooks
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
